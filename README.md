What then is a # State # ??? A State is the existing expression of a program or a game. The program moves from State to State by having its current state be shaped by preceding events or user interactions --https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science). For example, in Tic-Tac-Toe, in Chess, or even in Solitaire, the program moves from state to state to state based on each previous move by the program itself or by the human player. See below

For a more complex example, look at the next two pictures/graphs. In it one will see a much more complex system of going from state to state to state which is more typical to be found when trying to represent the workings in a computer program. In this case, changes from state to state to state also create different rewards for all possible moves with each transition.
